# apache-logs (container)
This is a clone from Ed Siper's [Github](https://github.com/edsiper/apache-logs) (FluentBit).  <br />
This is a very simple container used to send mock Apache Web Server access log activity to STDOUT (every few seconds). <br />  
This container is used to demo different logging solutions e.g. FluentBit, etc when it comes to obtaining visibility via containerized workloads. <br />
